# Emergency-Contact-App
Emergency Contacts App for Road Accidents This mobile and desktop-friendly app is designed to assist road accident victims by instantly notifying their emergency contacts in case of a crash. The app collects the user's personal and emergency contact information during setup. In the event of an emergency, the app can be manually or automatically triggered to send an alert message—along with the user's current GPS location—to pre-saved contacts via SMS or email.
